This is NOT the Fiat of yesteryear (which I also had), it is a modern FCA product with great quality control, nice fit and finish, and solid reliability. The only issue I had with either FCA Fiat was the separation of the side skirts on the Abarth, as noted below. Took a couple tries, but eventually fixed under warranty."

Zero issues with it, other than the side skirts separating, which is a known defect and the dealers took care of it under warranty, even after the mileage warranty had expired. More reliable than the 3 Audis I‚Äôve owned over the last 20 years, which all cost twice as much as the Fiat."

Please visit our transportation webpage at http://www.rarecars.com/shipping for a best-rate shipping quote from our transport partner.\nAlternatively, Rarecars can arrange no-fuss shipping not to exceed $1,500 for open-trailer transportation anywhere within the contiguous 48 states. Enclosed shipping won‚Äôt top $2,000 for the same delivery area.\n\nMost of our buyers have found that shipping is more cost-efficient and less time-consuming than making a special trip to pick up their new car.\n\nIf you plan to pick up the vehicle in person, by the California DMV law, we must collect a 9% sales tax. As such, Rarecars cannot provide a temporary permit to out-of-state buyers. The buyers don‚Äôt pay CA sales tax if they arrange a shipment, bring a trailer, or get a temporary permit from their state to drive the vehicle out of California.\n\nWe‚Äôre here to answer your questions!"

Our solid reputation comes from being transparent and forthcoming. We‚Äôll share the specifics in the listing if we notice something during our pre-auction multi-point inspection and test drive. We‚Äôre here to be upfront, an approach that serves everyone.\nImportantly, Rarecars owns every vehicle that we list for sale. There are no consignments or third parties! Putting our name behind every car ensures bidders and buyers an easy and drama-free experience.\n\nPart of the auction process involves asking questions of the seller. Rarecars is here to provide prompt and complete answers within 24 hours. We encourage observers and bidders to reach out with queries rather than post assumptions or guesses. Keep in mind that some replies involve an extra inspection or a trip to a dealer, which may delay our response. We want you to have as much information as possible, which sometimes takes additional time. We appreciate your patience in these situations.\n\nSignificantly, questions should be asked before bidding, especially if the inquiry involves logistics or payment. As per BAT policy, a bid is a non-conditional commitment to purchase a vehicle. We strongly recommend getting the answers you need before promising to buy.\nRarecares welcomes friendly and polite bidders, and we do our best to encourage a stress-free buying atmosphere.

Manufacturers have had many years to develop and dial in fuel management, ignition, and emissions systems. Cars today run great. This ain‚Äôt 1977 with the disastrous, poorly performing cars of that era. My 2015 bone stock Abarth runs great, and goes like stink. If you get one, leave it alone and just drive it. Don‚Äôt put it away hot though, drive it easy the last few miles to let things cool off a bit. Actually, this applies to any car, especially a turbocharged one."

    "comment": "Welcome to our weekly Bring a Trailer auction! This latest offering features an excellent 2014 Fiat Abarth with only 42k miles. This tiny but mighty vehicle embraces all the hallmark characteristics of a Fiat. Most importantly, this Abarth boasts superb condition, inside and out, and drives like it just left the factory.\nGiven this car‚Äôs background, prospective buyers will unlikely encounter a similar vehicle. Not to mention, this Abarth was regularly serviced. Adding to this Abarth‚Äôs strong appeal is an accident-free and smoke-free history, along with a recent multi-point inspection and service.\n\nWe encourage every bidder to review the accompanying photographs and test-drive videos thoroughly. These images offer a top-to-bottom look at this remarkable Abarth. We do our best to inspect for and disclose defects, including minor cosmetic blemishes. However, not all imperfections may be noticeable in the photos. Further, there may be nominal mechanical issues that have gone undetected. Through a detailed multi-point inspection and test drive, we do our utmost to uncover any non-standard factors. We will disclose anything we come across, but we want to provide a friendly reminder that the vehicle is sold without a warranty after the sale.\n\nWe‚Äôre proud of every vehicle we sell and welcome prospective buyers to visit our Silicon Valley dealership to view and inspect this notable Abarth. Don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us to arrange an inspection appointment to see this Abarth in person. We‚Äôre located five minutes from San Jose International airport.\n\nTo ensure the smoothest buying experience, all vehicles are stored in our secure facility and ready for immediate delivery or shipping. This low-mile 2015 Fiat Abarth is waiting for a new owner. We wish you successful bidding and good luck with the auction.\n\nThank you!\nJake and the Rarecars Team"
